<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Morse Code maps each letter to a sequence of dots and dashes.

How do you determine which sequence each letter should receive? If you think about it, you would probably want the most common letters to have shorter sequences, and the letters that are not used that much to get the longer sequences.

I performed a letter frequency analysis using the Python NLTK library, the NLTK Brown corpus, and Spr√•kbankens Swedish corpus 'talbanken' together with their python module 'sb-nltk-tools'. Check out my results in the demo!
